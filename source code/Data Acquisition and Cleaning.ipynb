And to further complicate matters, Lan Mo's possession of the hair clip may turn out to be more than just mere coincidence.\",\n          \"Inspector Zenigata has been removed from the Lupin case which leaves him despondent, and he ends up drinking with Lupin &amp; Jigen. Lupin decides that he and his gang should work with Zenigata to solve his new case, investigating a group of arms dealers known as Shot Shell. Lupin gathers his partners together (Jigen, Goemon, &amp; Fujiko), and with Zenegata they steal a Russian submarine. They kidnap a scientist named Karen Korinsky to help them operate the sub, and also to protect her from Shot Shell. Meanwhile the ICPO assigns a man named Keith Hayden to the Lupin case, and unlike Zenigata he wants Lupin and his group dead. Where ever Lupin and friends go, Keith follows, as the officer attempts to pick them off one by one. \\n\\n(Source: ANN)\",\n          \"Seven years after the events of Dragon Ball Z, Earth is at peace, and its people live free from any dangers lurking in the universe. However, this peace is short-lived; a sleeping evil awakens in the dark reaches of the galaxy: Beerus, the ruthless God of Destruction.\\n\\nDisturbed by a prophecy that he will be defeated by a \\\"Super Saiyan God,\\\" Beerus and his angelic attendant Whis start searching the universe for this mysterious being.

Lupin gathers his partners together (Jigen, Goemon, &amp; Fujiko), and with Zenegata they steal a Russian submarine. They kidnap a scientist named Karen Korinsky to help them operate the sub, and also to protect her from Shot Shell.
